title: "Nightmare"
author: "Laila"

In many times throughout my carrer I have felt like I was having the worse data **Nightmare**. I know that I suppose to be describing the **worst** but they were all as bad. The good thing is that all of them have the same issue in commmon and is about:

1) Having so many version of the same file with wrong labels or confunsing labels so then you dont really know whats the next files you should be working on.

2) Calculations and changes over an excell file without writting down what was done so at the time of going back and re-doing some of the analysis it was impossible to figure out what was going on with the data.

3) Having such a mess on data that when it comes to analyze it in a different way or re doing some of the figures you feel like thats the last thing you wanna do in the daya. Cosenquently you keep pushing that ugly work the whole week!

I am positive that this class will definetly improve our skills to manage data and documents to avoid painfull experience like most of us had at some point.
