1) Which rule are you most likely to follow and why?  
2) Which rule do you think you may never follow and why?  
3) Which rule would you really like to follow, but know deep down that you will fail? Why?

## Instructions:
Copy and save a **new copy** of this file, replacing "Lastname" and "Firstname" with your own and leaving the original unedited.

In **your copy**, replace the `title:` and `author:` fields in the YAML above, while leaving the remaining fields intact. Remove the Prompt and Instructions sections and write your blog post!
